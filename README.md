## About the Video Course
Setting up Jenkins and running build jobs is not enough for a production infrastructure. For optimal performance and results, architecting, designing, and implementing a production-grade Jenkins deployment is essential.

This course gets you up and running with Jenkins and enables you to deliver an optimal Jenkins deployment. On your journey, you will explore and configure features such as high availability, security, monitoring, and backing up/restoring data, which are basically all of the things you need to implementing a scalable and production grade infrastructure. You will also learn how to implement distributed builds, automate build pipelines, and integrate your Jenkins deployment with external services, thus showing you how to increase your team's productivity with pipeline as a code building advanced pipelines faster and easier.

By the end of this video course, you will be able to automate, implement, secure, and manage your Jenkins deployment in no time.
